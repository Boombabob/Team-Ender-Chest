Players can choose how these ender chests are acessed by the /teamEChest (or /eChest) command.

/teamEChest [ender chest type] always - makes that ender chest type always open when player interacts with ender chest.

/teamEChest [ender chest type] never - makes that ender chest type never opens when player interacts with ender chest.

/teamEChest [ender chest type] onSneak - makes that ender chest type open when the player is sneaking and interacts with ender chest

/teamEChest (ender chest type) onUnSneak - makes that ender chest type opens only when the player isn't sneaking and interacts with ender chest

These access methods will never overlap, providing a seamless and simple user experience.
